these files are mainly meant for SAMPLE BASED tracker DAWS such as OpenMPT (Modplug Tracker)
Renoise, Nitrotracker, etc.

You may use them in other daws, they work just as fine in FL Studio,
but they work best in those trackers!

most of these samples are ripped from game soundfonts and other various things. you should
see where most of them came from in the metadata.
feel free to use them however!
